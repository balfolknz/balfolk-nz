### What is Balfolk Aotearoa/NZ?
This is the official website used for Balfolk Aotearoa/NZ. <br>
It'll serve as a convenient location for different people to learn more about Balfolk dancing and how they can get involved in NZ. <br>
It was made so that the content is separated from the code, making it easier to update its content by non-developers.
<br><br>
It's also installable on your phone as a shortcut, as it's been converted to a PWA. <br>
This makes the app more accessible by mobile users (and was just fun to do)

### What technologies does Balfolk Aotearoa/NZ use?
- **_NextJS_** is used to create the frontend and backend (this is a framework built on top of React)
- **_TailwindCSS_** is used to help with building the CSS  
- **_Vercel_** is used to deploy the website to the internet 
<br><br>

### Moving forward with Balfolk Aotearoa/NZ
Balfolk NZ is currently in version 1.0 for the production state.<br>
Future systems (such as authentication, bookings etc.) may be added, which is why NextJS was chosen instead of normal React, HTML/HTMX or a static site generated. <br>
This is because NextJS has better support for backend development.
