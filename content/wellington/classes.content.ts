        <strong>Balfolk</strong><br/>
        Balfolk is a folk dance and music movement from Europe that gives new life to traditional dances.<br/>
        A â€˜Bal Folkâ€™ is a social dance event that brings people of all ages and walks of life together through group and partner dances to have fun and connect. <br/><br/>

        It has a friendly, social and energising atmosphere. Dances are simple and easy to learn but also have depth so once you have learnt the basics, you can explore and play around with variations. <br/>
        It makes it accessible to people with all skill levels. <br/><br/>

        In the class, we will learn and practice the dances you would commonly find in a Bal Folk. <br/>
        You donâ€™t need any previous dance experience, curiosity is all you need ðŸ˜Š
        <br/><br/>

        <strong><em>Price:</em></strong> $10/class or koha for concession <br/><br/>
