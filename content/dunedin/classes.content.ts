        <strong>European contredanses</strong><br/>
        European contredanses, often simply called contredanses are a style of historical dance that originated in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.<br/>
        English country dance and Scottish country dance are well known forms of contredanses. <br/><br/>

        Contredanses typically involve groups of couples arranged in lines or squares and are characterized by a series of lively and coordinated group movements.  These dances played a significant role in the evolution of social dance in Europe and transformed French dance.
        <br/><br/>

        <strong>Balfolk</strong><br/>
        Balfolk dancing is a dynamic and inclusive genre of dance and music that draws from diverse European traditions.
        What sets it apart is its fusion of traditional elements with modern innovations and a willingness to adapt and evolve. <br/><br/>
        Balfolk is characterized by its accessibility, emphasizing community, social interaction, experience and improvisation. <br/>
        Participants of all ages and skill levels come together to enjoy these dances.  <br/>
        This dance form encourages creativity and embraces change, making it a vibrant and ever-evolving experience.
