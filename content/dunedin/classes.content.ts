        <strong>European contredanses</strong><br/>
        European contredanses, often simply called contredanses are a style of historical dance that originated in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.<br/>
        English country dance and Scottish country dance are well known forms of contredanses. <br/><br/>

        Contredanses typically involve groups of couples arranged in lines or squares and are characterized by a series of lively and coordinated group movements.  These dances played a significant role in the evolution of social dance in Europe and transformed French dance.
