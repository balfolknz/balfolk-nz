      question: "What kind of music is played?",
      answer: `
      <p>
        Balfolk dancing borrows music from a wide range of genres, and is often played with live musicians at events. <br>
        Here's the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31l26quk6sqf6ghg2ubbks45jnci?si=e7cd470cde504300" className="link">Spotify Playlist</a> that we use during our practises for your own enjoyment :)

      question: "What do I need to bring?",
      answer: `
      <p>
        Just a set of clothes that you wouldnt mind getting dirty<br/>
        Flat, leather sole shoes are ideal, but any comfortable pair of shoes (like sneakers) will do!
      </p>

      question: "Do I need to bring a partner?",
      answer: `
      <p>
        Absolutely not, but the more the merrier! <br/>
        Balfolk dances are often done in groups, and so we'll easily be able to fit you into one of our existing groups on the day.
