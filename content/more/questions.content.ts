      question: "What kind of music is played?",
      answer: `
      <p>
        Balfolk music has its roots in tradition while also embracing  innovation. <br/>
        It  features traditional instruments such as fiddles, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, and accordions, often blended in unique combinations with more modern instruments. <br/>
        This fusion of traditional and modern elements gives the Balfolk sound the distinctive musical diversity that forms the backbone of Balfolk dance events.<br/><br/>

      question: "What do I need to bring?",
      answer: `
      <p>
        Flat, leather sole shoes are ideal, but any comfortable pair of shoes (like sneakers) will do!<br/>
        Bring a positive attitude and a casual set of clothes.<br/><br/>
        While it's not necessary to bring a dance partner, it can be more enjoyable if you come with friends or as a couple. <br/>
        Balfolk events are typically very social, and you'll have the opportunity to dance with various people. <br/>
        If you play a musical instrument, you might also want to bring it along to participate in  euro-sessions or practice with others.
