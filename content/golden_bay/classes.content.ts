        <strong>Balfolk</strong><br/>
        Balfolk draws from the tradition of old European folk dances that are approached in a new way. <br/>
        Each session is led by dance teachers, and supported by dancers with experience of Balfolk, all accompanied by live music from local musicians. <br/><br/>

        There will be opportunities to learn the basics of the dances, integrating the steps with the flow of the music, and to improve dance technique.<br/>
        Suitable for teenagers and adults.<br/><br/>

        Dance teacher is Kevin Durkan. Co-dancers are Gita, Kristina, Lizzie, Nathan.<br/>
        Live music from Hullabalou musicians.
        <br/><br/>
