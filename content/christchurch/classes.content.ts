        Balfolk on the Dance-O-Mat <br/>
        Start the Festivities with a Free Outdoor Taster! <br/>
        While France sizzles in summer, we’ll be rugging up in scarves and gloves for a true Kiwi winter
        twist! Kick off the celebrations with a free, open-air taster for absolute beginners and seasoned
        dancers alike, held on Friday afternoon on the Dance-O-Mat (211 Manchester Street).  <br/>
        Experience warmth of French dance—no matter the winter chill!

        <h3>Le Petit Bal</h3>
        <p>
        Christchurch—Get ready to twirl, step, and celebrate Bastille Day with us at a vibrant Balfolk Bal! <br/>
        Join us for “Le Petit Bal” on Saturday, July 12, 2025, at the Somerfield Community Centre (47
        Studholme Street) for an unforgettable evening of French social dancing that will transport you to
        the heart of Bastille Day celebrations.<br/>
        Balfolk is all about community and joy, featuring folk valses, mazurkas, shottisches, and lively
        group dances from regions across France and Europe. (Note: This is French dancing, not Balkan!)<br/>
        Whether you’re a seasoned dancer or have never stepped onto a dance floor, this event is for you
        </p>
        <br/> <br/>

        <h3>Balfolk Dance Workshops</h3>
        <p>
        For those eager to dive deeper into Balfolk, we’re thrilled to offer two accompanying dance
        workshops to Le Petit Bal earlier in the day at the same venue. <br/>
        These relaxed, beginner-friendly sessions focus on the same easy-to-learn dances featured at the Bal. <br/>
        No prior experience or partner is required—just bring your enthusiasm!<br/>
        $15 per workshop, or $25 for both workshops.
